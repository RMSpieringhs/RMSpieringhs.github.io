                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspectral_imaging">Hyperspectral imaging</a> is a powerful technology that has gained popularity in various industries due to its ability to provide detailed and accurate information about objects and materials. This technology has been applied in many fields, including agriculture, medicine, and military surveillance. In this article, we will explore what hyperspectral imaging is, how it works, and its applications in different industries.</p>

                  <h2 id="what-is-hyperspectral-imaging-">What is Hyperspectral Imaging?</h2>
                  <p>Hyperspectral imaging is a non-destructive technique that captures and analyzes the spectral information of an object or material. This technology uses a hyperspectral camera, which captures images at different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. These images are then processed to create a hyperspectral data cube, which contains detailed spectral information about the object or material being analyzed.</p>
                  <h2 id="how-does-hyperspectral-imaging-work-">How does Hyperspectral Imaging Work?</h2>
                  <p>Hyperspectral imaging works by capturing images of an object or material at different wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, typically ranging from visible light to near-infrared or shortwave infrared. Each pixel in the image contains spectral information about the object or material at that particular wavelength. This information is then used to create a hyperspectral data cube, which contains a spectral signature for each pixel in the image.</p>
                  <p>Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful technique that can be used in various fields, including agriculture, medicine, and remote sensing. There are four different scanning techniques used for acquiring hyperspectral data, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
                  <p>The first technique is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3895860/">spatial scanning</a>. In this technique, a strip of the scene is projected onto a slit and dispersed with a prism or a grating. The resulting 2D sensor output represents a full slit spectrum (x, λ). Line-scan cameras are commonly used in remote sensing, where platform movement or scanning is required to collect the spatial dimension. Point scanning is a special case of line scanning, where a point-like aperture is used instead of a slit, and the sensor is essentially one-dimensional instead of two-dimensional.</p>
                  <p>The second technique is <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/techniques/confocal/spectral-imaging-and-linear-unmixing">spectral scanning</a>. In this technique, the hyperspectral imaging device obtains a monochromatic, spatial map of the scene for each 2D sensor output. The scene is spectrally scanned by exchanging one optical band-pass filter after another while the platform remains stationary. This technique can suffer from spectral smearing if there is movement within the scene, but it has the advantage of being able to pick and choose spectral bands and having a direct representation of the two spatial dimensions of the scene.</p>
                  <p>The third technique is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3393130/">non-scanning</a>. In this technique, a single 2D sensor output contains all spatial and spectral data, without any scanning. Snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems use this technique to yield the full datacube at once. The most prominent benefits of these systems are the snapshot advantage (higher light throughput) and shorter acquisition time. However, computational effort and manufacturing costs are high.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and final technique is <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-53-20-4594">spatiospectral scanning</a>. This technique combines some of the advantages of both spatial and spectral scanning. Each 2D sensor output represents a wavelength-coded, spatial map of the scene. Advanced spatiospectral scanning systems can be obtained by placing a dispersive element before a spatial scanning system. Scanning can be achieved by moving the whole system relative to the scene, by moving the camera alone, or by moving the slit alone.</p>
                  <p>Overall, the choice of scanning technique depends on the specific application, as each technique has context-dependent advantages and disadvantages. Researchers and engineers must carefully consider their needs when selecting a scanning technique to obtain high-quality hyperspectral data.</p>
