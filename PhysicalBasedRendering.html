                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering">Physical based rendering (PBR)</a> is a rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to create realistic and accurate images. It is widely used in 3D graphics and gaming industries to create high-quality images that closely resemble real-life objects and environments.</p>

				  <h2 id="understanding-physical-based-rendering">Understanding Physical Based Rendering</h2>
                  <p>PBR is based on the laws of physics that govern the behavior of light. It takes into account factors such as light source, surface reflectance, and material properties to create accurate and realistic images. This is achieved by using a combination of techniques such as ray tracing, global illumination, and BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function).</p>
                  <h3 id="what-is-ray-tracing-">What is Ray Tracing?</h3>
                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)">Ray tracing</a> is a technique used to simulate the behavior of light by tracing the path of rays from the light source to the camera. This technique calculates the interactions between light and surfaces to create realistic shadows, reflections, and refractions.</p>
                  <h3 id="what-is-global-illumination-">What is Global Illumination?</h3>
                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_illumination#:~:text=Global%20illumination%20(GI)%2C%20or,realistic%20lighting%20to%203D%20scenes.">Global illumination</a> is a technique used to simulate the indirect light that bounces off surfaces and illuminates other parts of the scene. This technique takes into account the reflective and refractive properties of surfaces to create accurate and realistic lighting.</p>
                  <h3 id="what-is-brdf-">What is BRDF?</h3>
                  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_reflectance_distribution_function">Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)</a> is a mathematical function that describes how light is reflected from a surface. It takes into account the angle of incidence and the surface properties to calculate the amount of light that is reflected in a specific direction.</p>
                  <h2 id="history-of-physical-based-rendering">History of Physical Based Rendering</h2>
                  <p>The concept of physically based rendering originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The initial research focused on modeling and simulating the behavior of light and materials, which were based on the laws of physics. However, the development of physically based rendering techniques didn&#39;t gain traction until the mid-1990s with the introduction of radiosity and ray tracing algorithms.</p>
                  <h2 id="the-importance-of-photorealism">The importance of photorealism</h2>
                  <p>Virtual Reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we showcase products, buildings, and lighting installations to customers. With its immersive environment, users can experience a computer-generated reality that feels and looks real. However, while virtual renderings can provide useful information, they often fail to capture the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/discover/pbr.html">physical realism</a> of the environment accurately. This is due to the limited number of reflection and light emission properties that most 3D computer graphics software packages use, which reduces computation time. As a result, physical-based rendering is crucial in creating luminance images that accurately reflect reality, particularly in the context of evaluating indoor and outdoor lighting installations.</p>
                  <h2 id="device-dependent-color-space">Device dependent color space</h2>
				  <p>One of the biggest challenges in achieving physical realism is the <a href="https://aldertech.com/color-101-color-spaces/">device-dependent color space</a> that virtual renderings are typically processed in, leading to differences in perception on different computer screens or devices. While calibrating or characterizing each screen is a solution, it requires expensive equipment and a conversion between device-dependent and device-independent color spaces. A more practical approach is to create virtual renderings in a device-independent color space, which can be achieved through a physical renderer like Mitsuba. </p>

				  <h2 id="physical-based-renderer-mitsuba">Physical based renderer Mitsuba</h2>
                  <p>Mitsuba is a well-known physical renderer that can efficiently create renderings in a device-independent color space with acceptable computer computation costs. Its input includes information about the light intensity distributions (LID) for each fixture, reflection characteristics for each object expressed by bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and the camera/render characteristics, resulting in a virtual rendering that accurately reflects reality.</p>
